# Self Driving Project

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to train a deep neural network to drive a car in a simulator. The simulator provides the car with images from three cameras mounted on the car, as well as the steering angle, throttle, brake, and speed of the car. The simulator also provides the user with the ability to record training data by driving the car manually. The training data is used to train the neural network to predict the steering angle based on the images from the three cameras. The trained neural network is then used to drive the car autonomously around the track.
